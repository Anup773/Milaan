// Bikram Sambat (BS) calendar for the screen: converts AD <-> BS so dates can be SHOWN the way a Nepali company writes them.
// GENERATED from engine/engine/calendars/bs_data.py (BS 2000-2099); do not edit by hand. The engine reads and stores
// everything in AD; this file only formats. Every day from 1943-04-14 to 2043-04-12 converts identically here and in the
// engine, and an engine test fails if a year's row here differs from the engine's table.
//
// BS month lengths are 29-32 days and differ by year with no formula, so a table is the only way. Years up to
// 2083 are confirmed against four public sources; later years are PROVISIONAL (they may be a day out in a month).
